# LogicN Documentation Coverage

This document tracks what has been documented, what needs more depth, and what
is still missing across the three primary areas of the language specification.

```text
✅ Covered — dedicated KB file exists with full specification
⚠️  Partial — touched in a KB file but needs its own dedicated document
❌ Missing — not yet documented, work still required
```

## Summary: Gaps to Address

### Priority 1 — Core Syntax Gaps

```text
❌ Type definition syntax (type Foo { field: Type })
❌ Enum syntax (enum Status { Paid, Failed })
❌ Generic type syntax (Option<T>, branded types)
❌ Import / module system
❌ Visibility (public / private)
⚠️ API, database, worker, queue declaration blocks — unify into one KB
⚠️ Money<Currency>, Matrix, Vector, Tensor types
```

### Priority 2 — Logic Gaps

```text
❌ Error propagation through call chains
❌ How uses authority propagates through nested flows
⚠️ Pattern matching — richer examples needed
⚠️ Runtime vs compile-time authority unified explanation
```

### Priority 3 — Runtime Gaps

```text
❌ Build system and logicn build / logicn deploy CLI
❌ Deployment model (build-once, deploy-many)
❌ CI/CD integration (OIDC, SLSA provenance, attestation)
❌ Runtime audit log format
⚠️ Bootstrap roadmap — dedicated KB beyond automated-runtime-trust-strategy.md
⚠️ Compiler error codes — promote from logicn-core/docs to main KB
⚠️ Observability integration — promote from logicn-core/docs to main KB
```
